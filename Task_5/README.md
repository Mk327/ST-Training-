It's the same as myfemtoshell but the difference is that when the user enters a command
I didn't implement I'll use the execvp function to search for the command in the PATH 
environment and after that execute the command by the child that generated by fork
and make the parent wait untill the child died. 
** I added a technique to make the cmd has a varible size using the dynamic memory allocation.
EX of o/p:
Ana Fel ALforma Alnharda > hi
Please insert a valid command
Ana Fel ALforma Alnharda > ls 
a.out  mypicoshell2.c
Ana Fel ALforma Alnharda > pwd
current working directory: /home/public/Task_5
Ana Fel ALforma Alnharda > echo ali ali
ali ali 
Ana Fel ALforma Alnharda > echo mohamed 
mohamed 
Ana Fel ALforma Alnharda > echo 

Ana Fel ALforma Alnharda > touch file3
Ana Fel ALforma Alnharda > exit
