In this task we ask the user to enter a string and then print it 
Untill he type "exit" so the program will terminate 

So I used the following shell commands

1-vim file name.c 
to write the c program in the file 
2- gcc 
to compile the file.c and make it executable
3- ./a.out 
to excute the program 

Example of the o/p :

Ana Fel ALforma Alnharda > hello sadiki
You said : hello sadiki
Ana Fel ALforma Alnharda > 3aml eh
You said : 3aml eh
Ana Fel ALforma Alnharda > exit
skt al slama
